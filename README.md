1. From the route project, you need to install node modules: npm install
2. Install expo cli globally: npm install expo-cli --global
3. That's it.. now you can run your app: npm start or expo start

In order to run on a real device, you need to install Expo app on your phone. 

Check Expo Docs for building instructions: https://docs.expo.io/distribution/building-standalone-apps/
